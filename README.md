### Auto-Scroller Game
# ExtinctFromExtinction

This program is an auto-scroller game that features a dinosaur trying to survive as long as possible while accumulating as much wealth as possible (just like in real life). 

## Game Mechanics
In this game, you have 3 lives, whenever you fall in lava or get hit by a meteor you lose a life. The game gets harder as it progresses because the speed increases gradually the farther it goes

### Score
Your score in this game increases for every coin you collect and for every few seconds you stay alive. One of the main objectives in this game is to stay alive for as long as possible

### Controls
f- begin game <br>
space- jump/double-jump <br>
shift- dash: quickly moves forward  <br>
s- pound: dino quickly moves downwards until it hits a platform \n

### Design Choices
The dash function, double jump, and pound all provide extra mobility midair. This ensures that, with optimal play, you could always dodge both over and under the meteors no matter where they spawn. 




This program was made by me and my groupmates at the UT Austin Game Design Course using the Phaser Physics Engine.
