### Auto-Scroller Game
## ðŸ¦– Welcome to ExtinctFromExtinction ðŸŽ‰
#### This program is an auto-scroller game that you guide a dinosaur through a perilous journey of survival, coin collection, and epic dodging! Itâ€™s a test of your reflexes and strategy â€” stay alive, collect coins, and aim for the top score.
## ðŸš€ **Features**
- Endless Gameplay: No end in sight! Survive as long as you can while the game speed increases.
- Dynamic Difficulty: The longer you last, the harder it gets. Think fast or perish!
- Simple Controls: Just one button to jump â€” itâ€™s easy to pick up but hard to master.
- Challenging Obstacles:
   - You have 3 lives.
   - **Lava Pits** and **Meteor Showers** are out to get you â€” lose a life each time you fall or get hit.
- Score System: Your score in this game increases for every coin you collect and for every few seconds you stay alive.
- Compete with friends to see who can top the leaderboard!

## ðŸŽ® **Controls**
f- begin game <br>
space- jump/double-jump <br>
shift- dash: quickly moves forward  <br>
s- pound: dino quickly moves downwards until it hits a platform 

## Design Choices
The dash function, double jump, and pound all provide extra mobility midair. This ensures that, with optimal play, you could always dodge both over and under the meteors no matter where they spawn.
